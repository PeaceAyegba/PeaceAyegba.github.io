# Peace Ayegba — Personal Website

A simple, professional single‑page site suitable for GitHub Pages.

## Quick Start (GitHub Pages)

1. **Create a new repository** on GitHub (suggested name): `peace-portfolio`.
2. Upload **`index.html`** from this folder (or commit/push it).
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**:
   - **Build and deployment**: *Deploy from a branch*
   - **Branch**: choose `main` (or `master`) and the root (`/`), then **Save**.
4. After a minute, your site will be live at:
   - `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/peace-portfolio/`
   - Or at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/` if you use a repository named `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`.

## Customising

- Edit `index.html` and replace:
  - `youremail@example.com` with your real email.
  - Project links in the **Projects** section to your actual repos/notebooks.
  - Add a direct link to your **Google Scholar profile** if you have a dedicated URL.
- Content is in one file for simplicity; styling is inline (no build step).

## Local preview

Just open `index.html` in any browser.

## Notes

- A minimal, accessible design with no external JS—just a Google Font.
- You can safely add a `.nojekyll` file at the repo root if needed, but it’s not required.
